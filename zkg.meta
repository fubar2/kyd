description = KYD creates DHCP client hashes and logs the fingerprints and associated device information in a separate log file 'dhcpfp.log'. The Unknown fingerprints can easily be queried to the Fingerbanks API using the 'dhcp-unknown.py' script provided in this package, resulting dhcp-db-extend output file can be appended to the local dhcp-db.bro, and also can be shared with the community using dhcp-db-FBQ file generated by the python script.
